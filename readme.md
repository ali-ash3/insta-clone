# Insta Web Clone


## Why Instagram?

Why specifically Instagram? The basic reason is that Instagram has Authentication, Authorization, various interactive capabilities, etc features that can be implemented in different future projects/apps/technologies/websites. So I started off practicing by selecting Instagram's clone. The technologies that I mentioned earlier are some of the most advanced ones to start with, but worth the time and effort that they need. I hope this will help me in the long run in my future projects that I am looking forward to as well.
